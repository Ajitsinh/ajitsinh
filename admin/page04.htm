&quot;SKILL WITH PEOPLE FOR CARRIER SUCCESS &amp; HAPPY LIFE&quot;
<br>
<br>
<u>Understanding People and Human Nature</u>:<br>
<br>
People are primarily interested in
themselves and not in you!<br>
<br>
Putting this same thought another way:<br>
The other person is ten thousand times
more interested in himself than he is in you.<br>
<br>
And vice versa! You are interested more in yourself than you are in any other person
in the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>How to skillfully talk to people</u>:<br>
<br>
Take these four words out of your vocabulary -
“I, me my, mine”.<br>
<br>
Substitute for those four words with one word -
“You”
<br>
which is the most powerful
word spoken by the human tongue.<br>
<br><br>
<u>How to skillfully make people feel important</u>:<br>
<br>
1. Listen to them<br>
<br>
2. Applaud and compliment them<br>
<br>
3.Use their names and pictures as often as possible<br>
<br>
4. Pause before you answer them<br>
<br>
5. Use their words - “You” and “Your”<br>
<br>
6. Pay attention to everybody in a group<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>How to skillful listen to people</u>:<br>
<br>
Look at the person who is talking and try not interrupt suddenly.<br>
<br>
Lean to the words of the speaker and listen intently.<br>
<br>
Ask questions politely, sometimes it helps.<br>
<br>
Stick to speaker’s subject and do not try to change the core interest.<br>
<br>
Use the speakers words-“You” and “Your”.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>HOW TO SKILLFULLY CRITIQUE PEOPLE</u>:<br>
<br>
Criticism should be made in absolute privacy, this is most important.<br>
<br>
Preface criticism with a kind word or compliment.<br>
<br>
Make the criticism impersonal-criticism the act, not the person<br>
<br>
Ask for cooperation, do not demand it.<br>
<br>
One criticism to an offence.<br>
<br>
Finish the criticism on a friendly note.<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>How to skillfully thank people</u>:<br>
<br>
When you say “thank you”, MEAN it. Be sincere when you thank people.<br>
<br>
Say it clearly and distinctly.<br><br>
When thanking people, don’t mumble, whisper or
slur the words.<br><br>
Say thanks AS if you are glad you are saying it.

Say it clearly and distinctly.<br>
<br>

Look at the people you thank.
Thank people by name.
<br>
<br>
Work at thanking people so often to improve the skill.
<br><br>

<br>
<u>HOW TO SKILLFULLY MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION</u>:<br>
<br>
Be sincere.
Show enthusiasm.
Don’t be overanxious.<br>
<br>
Don’t try to build yourself up by running other people down.<br>
<br>
Don’t knock anybody or anything.<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>How to skillfully make a talk</u>:<br>
<br>
Know what you want to say.<br>
<br>
Look at the audience while you talk.<br>
<br>
Talk about what the audience is interested in.<br>
<br>
Don’t try to make a speech.<p>*************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Knowledge itself is of no value, it's the use of knowledge that makes it
valuable.<br><br>
Putting this thought another way:<br>
Life does not pay off for you on what
you can do, life pays off for you on what you do.<br>
<br>
This knowledge is your key to a better life, more friends, more success, and more
happiness.
