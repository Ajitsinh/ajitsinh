A good way to give it back !!!<br>
<br>

A very shy guy goes into a bar and sees a beautiful woman sitting at the bar.<br> After an hour of gathering up his courage he finally goes over to her and asks, tentatively,<br> "Um, would you mind if I chatted with you for a while?" <br><br>

She responds by yelling, at the top of her lungs,<br> "No, I won't sleep with you tonight!"<br> Everyone in the bar is now staring at them. <br><br>

Naturally, the guy is hopelessly and completely embarrassed and he slinks back to his table. <br><br>

After a few minutes, the woman walks over to him and apologizes.<br> She smiles at him and says,<br> "I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.<br> You see, I'm a graduate student in psychology<br> and I'm studying how people respond to embarrassing situations." <br><br>

To which he responds, at the top of his lungs, "What do you mean, $200?"<br><br>

				When we were young kids growing up in America,<br> we were told to
				eat our
				vegetables at dinner and not leave them.<br> Mothers used to
				say: &quot;Think of the starving children in India and finish the
				dinner.&quot;<br><br> And now I
				tell my
				children:<br> &quot;Finish your math's homework.<br> Think of the children in
				India
				who would make you starve, if you don't.&quot;</font></font><br>
