&quot;10 Ways to be Happy&quot;<br>
<br>
All human beings worry sometime or the other. The following ten steps can help
you keep your worries at bay.<br>
<br>
Step 1: Never worry alone. Talk to someone about your problems. This will help
put your problems in proper perspective. <br>
<br>
Step 2: Get the facts: Find out if your worry has any basis. Write down what is
worrying you, it will help you isolate and identify the problem.<br>
<br>
Step3: Take action. Don't waste your time or energy on worrying. Try to confront
and resolve your problems. Avoiding difficulties creates more stress in the long
run. <br>
<br>
Step 4: Take care of your body: exercise daily, eat healthy food and get enough
sleep, because exercising will help relax your muscles. Taking care of your body
physically will not only reduce tension, but also gives more energy to deal with
the problem. <br>
<br>
Step 5: Live for the moment : don't worry about what will happen in the future
and what happened in the past. Focus instead on the present.<br>
<br>
step 6: Be positive: always focus on the positive side of things instead of
brooding on negative thoughts. Develop a sense of humour. <br>
<br>
Step 7: Set aside a worry period of about 30 minutes to think about your
problems, arrive at solutions and ease your tensions.<br>
<br>
Step 8: Remain busy: plenty of action is a cure for worry. Keeping yourself busy
eliminates negative thoughts from your mind. <br>
<br>
Step 9: Avoid self – medication: do not resort to taking unnecessary drugs or
alcohol. Take professional help, if needed.<br>
<br>
Step 10: Finally, count your blessings: whenever your worries make you feel low,
think of the blessings. You will start to feel better. <br>
