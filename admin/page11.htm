		<p>Mutual Trust: <br>
		 <br>
		TRUST is a very important factor for all
		relationships. When trust is broken, it is the end of
		the relationship. Lack of trust leads to suspicion,
		suspicion generates anger, anger causes enmity and
		enmity may result in separation. <br>
		 <br>
		A telephone operator received a phone call. She
		answered, &quot;Public Utilities Board.&quot; There was silence.
		She repeated, &quot;PUB.&quot; There was still no answer. When
		she was going to cut off the line, she Heard a lady's
		voice, &quot;Oh, so this is PUB. Sorry, I got the number
		from my Husband's pocket but I do not know whose
		number it is.&quot; <br>
		 <br>
		Without mutual trust, just imagine what will happen to
		the couple if the telephone operator answered with
		just &quot;hello&quot; instead of &quot;PUB&quot;.

		<p>NO POINTING FINGERS: <br>
		 <br>
		A man asked his father-in-law, &quot;Many people praised
		you for a successful marriage. Could you please share
		with me your secret?&quot; <br>
		The father-in-law answered in a smile, &quot;Never
		criticize your wife for her shortcomings or when she
		does something wrong. Always bear in mind that because
		of her shortcomings and weaknesses, she could not find
		a better husband than you.&quot; <br>
		 <br>
		We all look forward to being loved and respected. Many
		people are afraid of losing face. Generally, when a
		person makes a mistake, he would look around to find a
		scapegoat to point the finger at. This is the start of
		a war. We should always remember that when we point
		one finger at a person, the other four fingers are
		pointing at ourselves. <br>
		 <br>
		If we forgive the others, others will ignore our
		mistake too.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>CREATING PERFECT RELATIONSHIPS? <br>
		 <br>
		A person visited the government matchmaker for
		marriage, SDU, and requested &quot;I am looking for a
		spouse. Please help me to find a suitable one.&quot; The
		SDU officer said, &quot;Your requirements, please.&quot; &quot;Oh,
		good looking, polite, humorous , sporty,
		knowledgeable, good in singing and dancing. Willing to
		accompany me the whole day at home during my
		leisure hour, if I don't go out. Telling me
		interesting stories when I need companion for
		conversation and be silent when I want to rest.&quot; The
		officer listened carefully and replied, &quot;I understand
		you need television.&quot; <br>
		 <br>
		There is a saying that a perfect match can only be
		found between a blind wife and a deaf husband ,because
		the blind wife cannot see the faults of the husband
		and the deaf husband cannot hear the nagging of the
		wife. Many couples are blind and deaf at the courting
		stage and dream of perpetual perfect relationship.
		Unfortunately, when the excitement of love wears off,
		they wake up and discover that marriage is not a bed
		of roses. The nightmare begins.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>NO OVERPOWERING: <br>
		 <br>
		Many relationships fail because one party tries to
		overpower another, or demands too much. People in love
		tend to think that love will conquer all and their
		spouses will change the bad habits after marriage.
		Actually, this is not the case. There is a Chinese
		saying which carries the meaning that &quot;It is easier to
		reshape a mountain or a river than a person's
		character.&quot; <br>
		 <br>
		It is not easy to change. Thus, having high
		expectation on changing the spouse character will
		cause disappointment and unpleasantness. <br>
		 <br>
		It would be less painful to change ourselves and lower
		our expectations..</p>
		<hr>
		<p>RIGHT SPEECH: <br>
		 <br>
		There is a Chinese saying which carries the meaning
		that &quot;A speech will either prosper or ruin a nation.&quot;
		Many relationships break off because of wrong speech.
		When a couple is too close with each other, we always
		forget mutual respect and courtesy. We may say
		anything without considering if it would hurt the
		other party. <br>
		 <br>
		A friend and her millionaire husband visited their
		construction site. A worker who wore a helmet saw her
		and shouted, &quot;Hi, Emily! Remember me? We used to date
		in the secondary school.&quot; On the way home, her
		millionaire husband teased her, &quot;Luckily you married
		me. Otherwise you will be the wife of a construction
		worker.&quot; She answered ,&quot;You should appreciate that you
		married me. Otherwise, he will be the millionaire and
		not you.&quot; <br>
		 <br>
		Frequently exchanging these remarks plants the seed
		for a bad relationship. It's like a broken egg -
		cannot be reversed.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>PERSONAL PERCEPTION:<br>
		 <br>
		Different people have different perception. One man's
		meat could be another man's poison. A couple bought a
		donkey from the market. On the way home, a boy
		commented, &quot;Very stupid. Why neither of them ride on
		the donkey?&quot; Upon hearing that, the husband let the
		wife ride on the donkey. He walked besides them.
		Later, an old man saw it and commented, &quot;The husband
		is the head of family. How can the wife ride on the
		donkey while the husband is on foot?&quot; Hearing this,
		the wife quickly got down and let the husband ride on
		the donkey. <br>
		 <br>
		Further on the way home, they met an old Lady. She
		commented, &quot;How can the man ride on the donkey but let
		the wife walk. He is no gentleman.&quot;
		The husband thus quickly asked the wife to join him on
		the donkey. Then, they met a young man. He commented,
		&quot;Poor donkey, how can you hold up the weight of two
		persons. They are cruel to you.&quot; Hearing that, the
		husband and wife immediately climbed down from the
		donkey and carried it on their shoulders. <br>
		 <br>
		It seems to be the only choice left. Later, on a
		narrow bridge, the donkey was frightened and
		struggled. They lost their balance and fell into the
		river. You can never have everyone praise you, nor
		will everyone condemn you. Never in the past, not at
		present, and never will be in the future. <br>
		 <br>
		Thus, do not be too bothered by others words if our
		conscience is clear..</p>
		<hr>
		<p>BE PATIENT: <br>
		 <br>
		This is a true story which happened in the States. A
		man came out of his home to admire his new truck. To
		his puzzlement, his three-year-old son was happily
		hammering dents into the shiny paint of the truck. The
		man ran to his son, knocked him away, hammered the
		little boy's hands into pulp as punishment. When the
		father calmed down, he rushed his son to the hospital. <br>
		 <br>
		Although the doctor tried desperately to save the
		crushed bones, he finally had to amputate the fingers
		from both the boy's hands. When the boy woke up from
		the surgery &amp; saw his bandaged stubs, he innocently
		said, &quot; Daddy, I'm sorry about your truck.&quot; Then he
		asked, &quot;but when are my fingers going to grow back?&quot;
		The father went home &amp; committed suicide. <br>
		 <br>
		Think about this story the next time someone steps on
		your feet or you wish to take revenge. Think first
		before you lose your patience with someone you love.
		Trucks can be repaired. Broken bones &amp; hurt feelings
		often can't. Too often we fail to recognize the
		difference between the person and the performance. We
		forget that forgiveness is greater than revenge. <br>
		 <br>
		People make mistakes. We are allowed to make mistakes.
		But the actions we take while in a rage will haunt us forever. <br>
