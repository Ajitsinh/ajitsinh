There was a meeting of all the Surd freedom fighters.<br>
They were planning for a free Punjab. Santa Singh raised a point,<br>
&quot;Oh...we'll take Punjab from India but how would we develop it?&quot;<br>
That was a tough one indeed. Banta Singh had a brainwave...<br>
&quot;No problem! We'll attack Amrika, then Amrika would take over us and then<br>
we would become one of the States of USA and develop automatically.&quot;<br>
All the surds became happy with this very simple solution but an old surd
was not.<br>
Someone asked him why he wasn't happy.
The old surd replied,<br>
&quot;THAT'S ALL VERY WELL...WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF BY CHANCE
WE TOOK OVER AMRIKA???&quot;</p>
