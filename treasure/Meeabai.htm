										<p><font color="#00FF00" size="5">Mewar will 
										remain forever at the top of the world 
										history for its
										courage, bravery and sacrifices. When the 
										women of Mewar were
										encouraging their husbands/sons/ 
										brothers to fight with the 
										enemies, the Bhakti Ganga of South was 
										spreading towards the North. The
										people of Rajasthan were busy in 
										fighting battles with the invaders. India and Indian culture was 
										badly affecting by the invaders
										attack. There was nothing to hope except 
										the God. In such a period a glomming star arose in the sky of Mewar 
										which enlightened the hearts
										and the lands with its Bhakti Prakash. It 
										was no other but the Saint
										Meerabai. Kojagiri Paurnima is the birth 
										anniversary day. So it will be
										our duty to remember her and her Bhakti 
										today. Meera was born in 1406
										(Vikram 1561) in Kurkee village of 
										Medata kingdom. She was the
										granddaughter of Rao Dudaji, son of 
										Rathore Raja Rao Jodha, the
										founder of Jodhpur and was the only 
										daughter of Rao Ratan Singh.<br>
										<br>
										Twelve-year old Meera was married off to 
										the brave and victorious
										Rana Sangram Singh's (Rana Sanga's) eldest 
										son Prince Bhojraj. Meera's
										husband was the eldest and Prince Uday 
										Singh (Maharana Pratap's
										father) was the youngest. <br>
										<br>
										The country is celebrating the 500th 
										birth anniversary of Meera Bai.
										This article highlights her contribution 
										in helping the resurgence of 
										Hinduism, through her bhakti-bhav.<br>
										<br>
										Prince Bhojraj passed away after some 
										time following his marriage.
										Meera refused to accept widowhood and as 
										before her marriage,
										continued to stay engrossed in worship 
										of Lord Krishna. As a result 
										of this, her brother-in-law, King 
										Vikramaditya inflicted inhuman
										sufferings upon her forcing her to leave 
										Mewar and return to Medata
										to stay with her brother Jaimal. She has 
										sung in verse form thus:<br>
										<br>
										&quot;Ranaji Ab No Rahoongi Tori Hatki…<br>
										Ranaji The Kyanne Rakho Mahansun Vair,<br>
										Mahal Atari Hum Sab Tyag, Tyagyo Tharon 
										Sahar.<br>
										Ranaji The Kyanne Rakho…&quot;<br>
										<br>
										Finding a place in the frontline of 
										Vaishnava saints of Middle Ages,
										Meera, by renouncing Mewar and making 
										Medata, Vrindavan and Dwarka
										her destinations for rendering her 
										bhajan (religious songs), blew the
										conch-shell for Krishna-worship and 
										aroused the people's faith 
										towards one dharma (religion) and to 
										agitate against cruelty.<br>
										<br>
										</font><font color="#FF0000" size="6">Renouncement of Chittor:</font><font color="#00FF00" size="5"> <br>
										<br>
										In Vikram 1561, at the age of thirty, 
										Meera left Chittor for Medata,
										after giving alms to the Brahmins, gifts 
										to her followers, food and 
										clothes to the poor. When Meera climbed 
										into the palanquin to leave
										Chittor, it seemed as though life had 
										ebbed from Chittor. On crossing
										the outskirts of the palace, the 
										drum-beaters of Medata moved to the
										front while those of Mewar remained 
										behind. Decorated with the symbol
										of an eagle the five-coloured flag of 
										the Rathores and the orange <br>
										flag of Eklingnathji (Krishna) flew high 
										in the sky. King Vikramditya
										and other eminent personalities came to 
										see her off outside the town. 
										Meera turned to say to the Rana before 
										he returned, &quot;Kindly grant
										permission to this younger sister-in-law 
										of yours to leave this town 
										forever. Do forgive me for any wrong I 
										may have committed knowingly 
										or unknowingly. &quot;<br>
										<br>
										With the descent of this group of saints 
										and pilgrims accompanying 
										Meera, the dark groves of Medata again 
										came to life. The political
										situation had changed. Bahadur Shah 
										attacked Chittor; 13,000
										Kshatriya women jumped into the pits of 
										fire to perish forever. The
										fort of Chittor slipped from the hands 
										of the Sisodia clan but the
										kingdom was regained later. Meanwhile, 
										King Vikramaditya was killed
										by Banwir who occupied the kingdom of 
										Chittor. Banvir tried to kill
										Prince Uday Singh but Pannadhai forsook 
										her own son to save the life
										of Uday Singh. <br>
										<br>
										Alongwith Chittor, even Mewar fell into 
										the clutches of trouble. Rao
										Maldeo launched an attack on Medata. 
										Simple-hearted Veeram Deo
										relinquished his kingdom to Maldeo and 
										left for Ajmer to reach
										Narana. Meera Bai too was with him. Two 
										years after having left
										Medata, Meera left for Pushkar from 
										Narana. <br>
										<br>
										</font><font color="#FF0000" size="6">Departure for Vrindavan:</font><font color="#00FF00" size="5"><br>
										<br>
										While living in Pushkar, Meera had an 
										overpowering desire to go and
										stay in Krishna's birthplace, so along 
										with her followers and
										pilgrims, she left for Vrindavan. 
										Trudging over uneven and rocky
										paths full of pebbles and stones, she 
										kept moving forward in a trance 
										while singing, <br>
										<br>
										&quot;Chalan Vah Ides, Meera Ke Prabhu Giridhar 
										Nagar, Sunjyon Birad Naresh…&quot; <br>
										<br>
										On reaching the borders of Vrindavan, 
										she fell to the ground, losing
										all control over her emotions. With 
										tears pouring down her eyes, she 
										seemed as though she was bathing the 
										land of her lover. With full 
										devotion, Meera got immersed in arousing 
										the people through her
										bhajan-kirtan and preachings. Whoever 
										heard of Meera rushed to catch
										a glimpse of her. By entering into 
										dialogues with saints and 
										Vaishnavas of Vrindavan, Meera came to 
										occupy a place among the
										frontline Vaishnava saints.<br>
										<br>
										In Vrindavan, Meera not only helped to 
										uplift the religious
										environment, she even brought 
										enlightenment to the women towards the
										society. When the Hindus were silent 
										spectators to the cruelties of 
										Turk and Afghan rulers, then by 
										propagating the bhakti cult, Meera
										provided a support to the Hindu religion 
										while infusing the bhakti
										bhav in the people and arousing them to 
										protect their religion. <br>
										<br>
										</font><font color="#FF0000" size="6">Departure for Dwarka:</font><font color="#00FF00" size="5"><br>
										<br>
										After staying in Brij for twenty-five 
										years, Meera Bai, at the age of
										fifty-five, left for Dwarka. In these 
										twenty-five years, her fame had
										spread to far corners of the country and 
										even before she reached 
										Dwarka, news of her devotion to God had 
										already preceded her. Many
										saints and seers began to visit her 
										small dwelling in Dwarka. People
										saw how deeply she would get engrossed 
										in her Lord and start dancing 
										in front of her Lord's idol, looking 
										like an angel who had descended 
										upon earth.<br>
										<br>
										Meanwhile clouds of trouble had started 
										gathering over Mewar. Prince
										Uday Singh sent two sons of Jaimal and 
										other emissaries to bring
										Meera back from Dwarka as advised by the 
										priests of the kingdom. On
										the pretext of seeking permission from 
										her Lord, Meera entered the
										temple of Dwarka-dheesh, but never 
										returned. She became one with her
										Lord. </font></p>
										<p><font color="#00FF00" size="5">Although Meerabai is no more but she has 
										been being rememebered for
										centuries only because of her Bhakti 
										Rachanas and her great love for
										Lord Krishna. It is true that &quot;Swadeshe 
										Pujyate Raja; Vidvan Sarvatra Pujyate.&quot; Meerabai had achived and 
										attained the higher place in the
										Bhakti Sampradaya and the Indian 
										liturature.</font></p>
