Take a look at an apple tree. There might be five hundred apples on the tree, each with ten seeds. That's a lot of seeds. We might ask, &quot;Why would you need so many seeds to grow just a few more trees?&quot; Nature has something to teach us here. It's telling us: &quot;Most seeds never grow. So if you really want to make something happen, you had better try more&nbsp;than once.<br>
<br>
This might mean: <br>
<br>
You'll attend twenty interviews to get one job.<br>
You'll interview forty people to find one good employee.<br>
You'll talk to fifty people to sell one house, car, vacuum cleaner, insurance policy, or idea.<br>
And you might meet a hundred acquaintances to&nbsp;find one special friend.<br>
<br>
When we understand the &quot;Law of the Seed&quot;, we don't get so disappointed. We stop feeling like victims.
</p>
</p>

Laws of nature are not things to take personally. <br>
We just need to understand them - and work with them.<br>
<br>
IN A NUTSHELL: <br>
<br>
Successful people fail more often. They plant more seeds.<br>
When Things Are Beyond Your Control, here's a recipe for permanent misery: <br>
<br>
a) Decide how you think the world SHOULD be.<br>
b) Make rules for how everyone SHOULD behave.<br>
<br>
Then, when the world doesn't obey your rules, get angry!<br>
That's what miserable people do!<br>
<br>
Let's say you expect that: <br>
<br>
Friends SHOULD return favors.<br>
People SHOULD appreciate you.<br>
Planes/Trains SHOULD on time.<br>
Everyone SHOULD be honest.<br>
Your husband/wife SHOULD remember your birthday.<br>
<br>
These expectations may sound reasonable. But often, these things won't happen! So you end up frustrated and disappointed.<br> There's a better strategy: Have fewer demands. </p>

Instead, have preferences! For things that are beyond your control, tell yourself: </p>

&quot;I WOULD PREFER &quot;A&quot;, BUT IF &quot;B&quot; HAPPENS, IT'S OK TOO!&quot;
</p>

Always be prepared for the worst scenario in advance, that helps a lot.</p>

This is really a game that you play in your head.<br> It is a shift in attitude, and it gives you more peace of mind.<br>
<br>
You prefer that people are polite ... but when they are rude, it doesn't ruin your day.</p>

You prefer sunshine ...but if it rains then it should be ok too!<br>
<br>
To become happier, we either need to<br>
<br>
a) change the world, or<br>
b) change our thinking. </p>

I think it’s easier to change our thinking!<br>
<br>
IN A NUTSHELL: <br>
<br>
It's not what happens to you that determine your happiness, it's how you think about what happens to you... Give it try.....</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;CORRECTION DOES MUCH, BUT ENCOURAGEMENT DOES MORE!!!&quot;</p>

In life, there are enough times when we are disappointed, depressed and annoyed. But we have a wonderful world out there that is full of beauty, light and promise. So why waste time in this world looking
for the bad, disappointing or annoying things when we can look around us, and see the wondrous[remarkable/extraordinary/wonderful] things before us..?<br>
<br>
I believe that we are happiest when we see and praise the good and try our best to forget the bad. Nobody's perfect but we can find in them to change the way we see them.<br>
We are not trying to condone [</span>overlook/forgive] what is bad. <br>
CORRECTION DOES MUCH, BUT ENCOURAGEMENT DOES MORE!!! - believe me.<p>&nbsp;</p>

1. Life is not instant gratification and Instant use of friends.<br><br>
2. ABC= Avoid Bad company...<br><br>
a. Bad people will talk good in front of you, CHAAPLUSEE KARENGE.<br><br>
b. Behind your back they will invent and say bad things and spoil your reputation, if someone enquires about you, as they know bad person is your friend.<br><br>
c. ESPECIALLY FOR GIRLS- Good people will avoid you if you hang out or associate with Bad people.<br><br>
d. Aadmi dekhkar samajh kar then associate with Good people.<br><br>

3. Just because you think that some one will give you professional advantage, or can help you...don't be in a hurry to make friends / acquaintences with them...BAD PEOPLE NEVER HELP OTHERS, they only make excuses, waste your time...keep you hanging around so THEY CAN USE YOU AND TAKE YOUR HELP.<br><br>

a. Behind your back they make FUN of you.<br><br>

b. If you tell them about your success and accomplishments, THEY GET JEALOUS OF YOU AND AUTOMATICALLY START SPREADING RUMORS ABOUT YOU AND SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT YOU....and people are likely to believe them, as they see them associating with you.<br><br>

4. DON'T BE DESPERATE, NOTHING HAPPENS BY BEING FAST OR A CROOK...<br><br>
a. Shanti se, plan kar ke maa baap ya knowledgeable NOBLE logon ki advice le kar subah uth kar baba bhole naath ya Krishna Kanhaiya ka smarankar ke,...then calmly, systematically do your work and you will succeed.<br><br>
5. ONLY GOOD People help others, because IT IS THEIR NATURE TO HELP OTHERS.<br><br>
A. People who have helped you before are likely to help you again.<br><br>
B. Do not hesitate to calmly and politely ask for help from good people, if you delay, then you will be beyond help.<br><br>
C. Do NOT waste time with frivolous people when you need help, they will only laugh at you behind your back.<br><br>
&quot;RAHIMAN CHUP HI BAITIYE DEKH DINAN KA PHER,<br>
JUB NEEKE DIN AAHIYEN BANAT NA LAGIHE DER.&quot;<br><br>
D. Do not expect someone to help you just because you helped them. Such people will say they will help you, but if you rely on them, you will be disappointed...as they will NOT even tell you that they will
NOT help you, just to keep good relations with you in case THEY NEED YOUR HELP IN THE FUTURE....thus, you will waste a lot of time, and get frustrated and sad when they DO NOT COME THROUGH AND HELP YOU AS PER THEIR WORD.<br><br>

This is enough for today....Next Lesson will be about NETWORKING AND BECOMING A LEADER...SO YOU CAN GET HELP WHEN YOU NEED IT, WITHOUT WASTING TOO MUCH TIME...<br><br>

I don't want to overwhelm you with Knowledge...as you will not be able to absorb, retain and recall it when needed, if I do it fast.<br><br>
